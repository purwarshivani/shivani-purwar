    <p>i chossed my desgin template for my website form
      wix.com, where i saw Nicola Rider's website 
      desgin which seems quite attractive and simple.
      the color of website is eye friendly and also we can clearly
       know about the website just by having
      a look in its profile. the way it appear in responsive form and in desktop is quite impresive.The way pictures are placed in circle box which seems simple and eye cathcher .This site is responsive and looks better and simple as well to imagine the design and work in it too. There is menu bar in reponsive form where in desktop there is navigation bar. 
      As well as this website was listed among
      one of the best portfolio websites. this website of Nicola Rider
      follows all modern designing pattern.
       which suits best for my assignment requirement.
       Navigation system was
      simple yet, too attractive. Design can be achieved using
      only html and css with minimum use of javascript and other
      scripting tools.
